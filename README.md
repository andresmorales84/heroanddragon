Hero and dragon battle<BR><BR>
<BR>Rules
  1. use try/except and input to read: hero_hp, dragon_hp, hero_max_dmg and dragon_max_dmg.
  2. The dragon attacks the hero first, then the hero attacks the dragon
  3. They each take turns until one dies
  4. When the dragon attacks, the program computes a random number between 1 and dragon_max_dmg. This is the damage that the hero sustains. If the hero dies, announce it and the dragon wins.
  5. Same goes for the hero attack
